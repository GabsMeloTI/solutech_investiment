- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) or [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/)
- [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/) with Authentication and Firestore Database enabled

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solutech.git
    cd solutech
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Firebase**:
    - Create a new Firebase project.
    - Enable Authentication and Firestore Database.
    - Add your Firebase configuration in the `firebaseConfig.js` file.

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```

üîß Firebase Configuration
Create a `firebaseConfig.js` file in your project directory with the following content:

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);
const auth = getAuth(app);

export { db, auth };
```

## üê≥ Docker Setup

To containerize the application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
    FROM node:14

    # Set the working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy the rest of the application code
    COPY . .

    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the application
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=development
    ```

3. **Build and start the Docker containers**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. **Access the application**:

    The application should be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If you encounter issues, ensure that Docker is correctly forwarding the port and that there are no conflicts with other services on your machine.
